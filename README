This is the static frontpage site design for http://teachingopensource.org. The design is based on Ian Weller's ptkb, https://github.com/ianweller/promotional-teflon-kittenbasket.

This redesign was created by Mel Chua, http://blog.melchua.com/contact, in February 2012. Patches welcome.

Discussion of the design should take place on the TOS mailing list, http://lists.teachingopensource.org/mailman/listinfo/tos.
